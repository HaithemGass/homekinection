<p>This sample application demonstrates using ZDP requests to reveal properties of remote devices.</p>

<p>Up to 8 nodes may participate. Each node is identified by a unique short address specified as
the <tt>CS_NWK_ADDR</tt> parameter in the <tt>configuration.h</tt> file. This implies that each node
shall be programmed with a separately compiled firmware image. The device type is set at run time by the 
application depending on the short address value. Namely, if the short address equals <tt>0x0000</tt>,
then the application decides that this is the coordinator, otherwise, the device type is set to router.</p>

<p>On startup, the nodes form a network (a successful join to the network is indicated by the green LED flashing).</p>

<p>Connect one node serially to a PC to test the applicaiton functionality with Windows HyperTerminal.
After you set proper <a href="Sample_app.html#Connection">connection settings</a>, you will be prompted 
with the following menu:</p>
